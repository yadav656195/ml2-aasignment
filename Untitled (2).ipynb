    "Q1: Define overfitting and underfitting in machine learning. What are the consequences of each, and how can they be mitigated?\n",
    "Ans-Overfitting: Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model learns the training data too well, capturing noise or random fluctuations in the data rather than the underlying patterns. As a result, the model performs well on the training set but poorly on unseen data because it has essentially memorized the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequences: Poor generalization to new data, high accuracy on training set but low accuracy on test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mitigation: Regularization techniques, cross-validation, reducing model complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Underfitting: Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the training data. The model performs poorly on both the training set and unseen data because it fails to learn the relationships in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequences: Poor performance on both training and test sets, inability to capture complex patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mitigation: Increase model complexity, use more features, or choose a more sophisticated model."

Bias refers to the error introduced by approximating a real-world problem, which may be complex, by a simple model. Variance refers to the model's sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training data.\n",
